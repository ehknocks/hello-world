# hello-world

Hello! I'm coming back to coding for the first time in ages. I used to code all the time when I was a teenager, but never made it much farther than playing around with CSS to make sites look pretty. I've had some time on my hands lately, so I decided to try giving coding a chance, again. 

So far so good!
